# JJ Graph

This extension attempts to be, for `jj` what [Git Graph](https://github.com/mhutchie/vscode-git-graph) is to `git`

It is, at worst, a reimplementation of [Git Graph](https://github.com/mhutchie/vscode-git-graph) for `jj`, written in Vue

At best, it aims to be a comprehensive way to use `jj` in Visual Studio Code, to the extent that users will use the `jj` CLI only because they want to,
not because there is some functionality available in the CLI that's not supported or not easily doable by the extension

### Inspirations

* The primary inspiration for this project: [vscode-git-graph](https://github.com/mhutchie/vscode-git-graph)
* The VS Code Extension <-> `jj` interface: [jjk](https://github.com/keanemind/jjk)
* Using Vue in a VS Code Extension: [vscode-webvue](https://github.com/Mhdi-kr/vscode-webvue)
